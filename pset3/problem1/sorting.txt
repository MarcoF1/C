Given N arrays, each with M positive integers, sort each array in ascending order. Then print out the sorted arrays in descending order by their least element. That is, the array whose minimum element is the largest among the minimum elements of all arrays is first. It is guaranteed that there will be no ties.

You can submit multiple times to experiment with multiple implementations for practice, such as C-style pointer arrays versus C++ vectors, writing your own sort versus using std::sort, and so on.

INPUT FORMAT:

Line 1: Two integers N and M
Lines 2 to N+1: M integers per line
SAMPLE INPUT (stdin):
3 5
5 4 3 2 1
7 4 5 6 3
6 5 4 3 2


OUTPUT FORMAT:
Lines 1 to N: An array in ascending order with a space between integers.
SAMPLE OUTPUT (stdout):
3 4 5 6 7
2 3 4 5 6
1 2 3 4 5

Sample Explanation: Each array is sorted in increasing order. The minimum element of the arrays are 1, 3, and 2, respectively, so the 2nd array is printed first, followed by the 3rd, and lastly the 1st.
