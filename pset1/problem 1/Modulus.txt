Problem 1: Modulus

For integers a, b, and M, we say that a and b are congruent modulo M if a-b is divisible by M. For positive integers, this is equivalent to saying that a and b have the same remainder upon dividing by M.

Given N integers, find how many of them are congruent to m modulo M. It is guaranteed that M is positive and the integers have magnitude at most 1,000,000.

INPUT FORMAT:

Line 1: Three integers N m M
Lines 2 to N+1: One integer per line

SAMPLE INPUT (stdin):
5 1 2
1
8
21
13
42

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Line 1: The number of integers congruent to m modulo M
SAMPLE OUTPUT (stdout):
3

(Hint: What happens when you do a % M if a is negative?)
